# Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. 
# Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you 
# and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise, 
# it should yell back like this:
#
# WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!

puts 'WHAT DO YOU WANT?'
answer = gets.chomp
puts 'WHADDAYA MEAN "' + answer.upcase + '"?!? YOU\'RE FIRED!!'

# Hereâ€™s something for you to do in order to play around more with 
# center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will display a table 
# of contents
