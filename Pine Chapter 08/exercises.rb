# Building and sorting an array. 
# Write the program we talked about at the beginning of this chapter, one 
# that asks us to type as many words as we want (one word per line, 
# continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats 
# the words back to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program 
# thoroughly; for example, does hitting Enter on an empty line always exit 
# your program? Even on the first line? And the second? Hint: Thereâ€™s an
# array method that will give you a sorted version of an array: sort.

# Table of contents, revisited.

# (chapter names, page numbers, and so on). Then print out the information 
# from the array in a beautifully formatted table of contents.
